# UER-Analysis

## Summary:
Basic Exploratory Data Analysis using python and tableau. Exploring the relationship between UI benefits and UER in post COVID states, blocked by 'Pro' and 'Anti' UI states.

## Purpose:
Understand how UER and UI are associated between states that support Unemployment Insurance versus states that are against Unemployment Insurance. 

## Hypothesis:
Null Hypothesis: No association between UER and UI
Alternate Hypothesis: There is an association between UER and UI

## Method:
Random samples were selected among the 50 states in the U.S. States were blocked into either 'Pro' or 'Anti' UI based off of COVID policy towards Unemployment Insurance and were randomly chosen from their respective 'blocks'. Multiple statistical tests were used in our analysis, such as ANOVA, regression analysis, probability distribution tables and more. Throughout the project we test the hypothesis multiple times that there is not a relationship between UER and UI. Besdies that we also calcualte multiple other descirptive statistics to get a better picutre of UI spending in states. Finally we end the project with basic visualization in tableu.

## Results:
Throughout our project we reject our null hypothesis several times and find that there is a moderatly strong realtionships between UI and UER. On top off that we also find that before COVID, the UER of our sample states was fairly stable, showing the 'natrual rate' of unemployment. The most shocking discovery from this project though is the large difference in total money spent between our 'Pro' and 'Anti' UI data. On top off that our 'Pro' UI dataset contained more outliers regarding, actual Unemployment rates comapred to the 'Anti' UI data set which had a lower average UER and a smaller range of UER values.
